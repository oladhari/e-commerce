## Issues

please describe your task clearly and try to add a detailed checklist in purpose to finish your task

## Branch Names

we use semnatic commit messages rule to make the commit messages more readable and clear
[here](https://gist.github.com/joshbuchea/6f47e86d2510bce28f8e7f42ae84c716) you can find a link about it

and we use almost the same rule for branches, we avoid to do any changes in master branch to avoid any future conflict as a team
the branch name should start with one the semantic types then the related issue number
example adding header feature related to issue N 136 , format will be `feat/136_header`
Format: `<type>(<scope>)/<issue_number>_<subject>`
